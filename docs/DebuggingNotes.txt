Notes for testing

Random seed

Ashgard-Keep\scenes\Start.gd
The seed is printed to the console when the game first opens. You can change the value
of the game_seed to the one printed to the console if you want to run the same game again.

Maps

Ashgard-Keep\global\DungeonGen.gd
Uncommenting the line
#map_to_text()
will allow the dungeon generator to print the current dungeon to a text file, saved in the root directory.
The map is rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise

Save file

Ashgard-Keep\scenes\Game\Game.gd
The save files are encrypted by default. To turn off encryption during testing, find the following lines in 
the save function;

	#var opened = file.open(GameData.SAVEGAME_PATH, File.WRITE)# unencrypted for testing
	var opened = file.open_encrypted_with_pass(GameData.SAVEGAME_PATH, File.WRITE, GameData.ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD)

and the restore function;

	#var opened = file.open(GameData.SAVEGAME_PATH, File.READ)# unencrypted for testing
	var opened = file.open_encrypted_with_pass(GameData.SAVEGAME_PATH, File.READ, GameData.ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD)

and swap the commented / uncommented lines


Encryption password

Ashgard-Keep\global\GameData.gd
The password used for encryption
const ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD = "password"
