* Roadmap

The tasks below will create a game that has the bare minimum features. From that foundation, I can then start adding content, plot and interesting enemy AI.


* Tasks
** DONE Add full player stats
** DONE Amend sidebar theme
** DONE Allow game state to be saved on exit
** Game state auto-loaded on start
** Add a variety of dungeon tilesets that are randomly chosen on generation
